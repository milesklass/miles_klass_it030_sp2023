        <p>I am a well-organized, highly motivated individual who enjoys the challenges of working in a fast-paced office environment. Having completed work experience at Elevate Dynamics and Adventure Media Group, I have strong marketing skills, including working knowledge of Zendesk CRM, Google Analytics, and project management software, as well as email marketing software like MailChimp and Stripo. I have also learned how to interact with customers and clients through a customer support application called Podium.</p>

        <p>To strengthen my abilities in marketing, I enrolled in a digital marketing course at Hofstra, where I learned to create landing pages for specific products and ways to improve ads through simulated Google Analytics program. During this class, my creative and analytical skills were called upon to be successful. My interests and dedication would make me a valuable candidate for this job.</p>
