  <h2>Miles Alexander Klass</h2>
    <p>As a current junior at Hofstra University, I am starting to look for more internships in the digital marketing industry. I have learned the value of an open approach to learning and the importance of respecting the opinions of others. I pride myself on my ability to listen closely and follow through on instructions and directions to help bring about a successful outcome.</p>

I have also learned how to interact with customers and clients through a customer support application called Podium.</p>
